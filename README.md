# Railway Ticket Booking System (Java + MySQL)
 #Project Description

The Railway Ticket Booking System is a console-based Java application developed to manage train details and railway ticket booking operations.
This system allows users to view available trains, book tickets, cancel tickets, and view booked tickets using a MySQL database for data storage.

The project demonstrates the use of Core Java, JDBC, and MySQL in building a real-world database-driven application.
